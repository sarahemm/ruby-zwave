ruby-zwave
==========

Ruby interface library for controlling ZWave home automation devices.

SerialAPI functionality created with no access to Zensys NDA documentation via
public documentation and reverse engineering.
Any contributions must have public references for where the information
obtained was found, if adding new protocol functionality.

As of May 2014, this is under heavy development and still has frequent breaking API changes. Probably not ready for real use by anyone but me, yet.
